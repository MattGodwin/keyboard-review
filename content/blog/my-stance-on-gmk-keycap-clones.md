title: My stance on GMK keycap clones
description: What I think about GMK keycap clones.
---
Heya,

Recently there has been a great deal of controversy in the keyboard community due to the increasing amount of GMK clones on the market. This blog post is a bit different as I want to talk about my opinion on the matter.

GMK keycaps have been seen as the gold standard for keycaps for as long as I have been in the community, and it's clear why; they're great. But, they cost a fortune. GMK keycaps often cost upwards of £100 for the base kit alone, and it's easy to understand why newer members of the community find that insane; after all, they are just pieces of plastic. But it doesn't stop there, on the after market GMK caps can got for more than £500 and to be honest even I can't justify spending that much on a keycap set. A lot of what makes GMK caps so expensive, is the exclusivity. GMK sets are usually only sold in group buys, which is when the retailers take orders of the product in a specified buy period before it is actually produced and then when they have a confirmed number of orders they go off to GMK to get them produced. 

Now we have identified why they are so expensive, lets take a look at some of the disadvantages of GMK keycaps. Group buys can be frustrating as you might have to wait upwards of 6 months before you even get your keycaps. If you miss a group buy, there is a low chance that the keycaps will have a second round which means that if you miss the initial buy period you literally can't buy the keycaps unless you want to brave the aftermarket. Also, even though they are so exclusive and cool, at the end of the day they are just pieces of plastic.

This is where the GMK clones come into play. One quick trip to Ali-Express or Amazon will show you that similar sets can cost as low as £30. Better yet, these keycaps are sold all year round, and the only waiting period is shipping. These options can be very appealing, but a lot of these sets use stolen artwork and designs from the GMK sets without permission from the original designer. And for that reason I personally can't justify buying them. Buying counterfeit keycaps will only fund these clones and encourage them to steal more designs and profit from the designers hard work.

Although, not all keycap sets on Ali-Express are counterfeits. Lots of them have totally original designs and there are many sets that just take inspiration from the GMK sets, for example they use a similar colourway but use different artwork for the novelties etc. Personally, I don't have a problem with these sets as long as they don't use any designs that they don't have the rights to. I would actually recommend some of these sets to beginners as they are much easier to justify than some expensive GMK sets.

In conclusion, never fund or support counterfeit GMK sets. But, there are many other great options on sites like Banggood and Ali-Express just as long as they don't use any stolen designs. In many cases I would even recommend these sets over any GMK set as, at the end of the day, they are just pieces of plastic.
