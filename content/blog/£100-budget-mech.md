Heya, 

People always ask me, "What is a good first build?". Well actually they don't. But if they did, this is the keyboard I would recommend. 

The GK61X is a great starting point as it is great value for money and doesn't require any soldering. The kit includes the PCB, an ABS case, stabilizers, plate and a type C cable. For around £40 you really can't go wrong with it. If you prefer to have dedicated arrow keys, then go for the GK64X.

For the switches it is really down to personal preference, but in my case I went with Gateron Yellows as they are a smooth linear and when lubed, provide a great typing experience for a great price. If you would prefer a clicky switch, then I would recommend some Kailh Box Jades as they really are the king of the clicky's; although, they do cost a bit more and bring us over budget. When it comes to tactile switches in our budget, I would recommend Gateron Reds.

Again, when it comes to keycaps it is entirely down to personal preference but I love the look of the AKKO Neon keycaps. They are PBT which means that they will shine much less than other ABS alternatives and they use two-colour molding which means that the legend won't fade after use.
