title: Top 3 Budget Mechanical Keyboards
description: A list of my top 3 budget mechanical keyboards.

Heya,

Today, I have compiled a list of my top 3 favourite budget keyboards for beginners. In no particular order, lets get started!

### 1. GamaKay K61

([Purchase Link](https://www.banggood.com/custlink/vmmhljdwe1))

The GamaKay 61 is a great budget 60% keyboard coming in at around £50, there are 5 Gateron switch options to choose from but the keyboard is hot swap so you can always change them out for some different switches if want. The case is made from CNC cut frosted PMMA which allows for the RGB backlight to shine through with minimal hot spots. The board includes a USB C cable which is nice to see at this price point. The keycaps are white shine through ABS so the legend won't fade easily after use, but they might be vulnerable to shining so you might want to pick up another keycap set eventually. The GamaKay 61 comes with custom software to control the lighting and function layers although it isn't required. Overall, the GammaKay 61 is a great starter board and is a good place to start if you are interested in trying out multiple switches.

### 2. Keychron C1

([Purchase Link](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-c1-wired-mechanical-keyboard?variant=39309088948313))

The Keychron C1 is a great option if you are looking for a smaller board but you still require the function/arrow keys as it is a TKL design. You have 6 switch choices and can choose between Gateron switches and Keychrons own switches in Red, Blue and Brown options. The cheapest option doesn't have hot swap or a backlight but if you upgrade to the RGB, hot swap version then the board costs about £65. It uses double-shot PBT keycaps which allows the backlight to shine through with non chance of the legend fading or the caps shining. If you are looking for a budget TKL option, this is the board for you.

### 3. Geek Customised GK61

([Purchase Link](https://www.banggood.com/custlink/D3vELjE12N))

Last but not least, the Geek Customised GK61 is a budget 60% with the choice of 6 Gateron optical switches. Technically it is hot swappable although, it only supports optical switches so there is a much smaller range of compatible switches; and for that reason if you plan on trying out new switches with this board I would recommend the GamaKay K61. This board has support for 3 custom function layers which makes it great if you need lots of macros. The keycaps are double-shot shine through ABS which allows the RGB backlight to show through the legend, but unfortunately as they are ABS they are vulnerable to shining. It comes with a 1.5m USB C cable which is becoming the standard for budget boards nowadays. At the end of the day, if you are looking for a budget mechanical keyboard that just works out of the box with lots of function layers, I'd recommend the Geek Customised GK61. But in most cases, I'd recommend the GamaKay K61 for it's better overall customisation and quality.
