description: My review and personal opinion on Kailh Box Jade switches.
---
Heya,

This is my review of the Kailh Box Jade switches, but I'd like to preface this by saying that this review is mostly based on my own opinion and some people might have a different opinion and, at the end of the day when choosing switches, it is entirely down to personal preference. With that being said, lets get started!

Kailh Box Jades are one of the most well known clicky switches widely available on the market today and coming in at around £0.24 per switch they're very affordable. They are known for their thick click bar which gives a consistently satisfying click on both the down press and the return. Kailh opted to use their box-style stems to avoid stem wobble and improve keycap stability. The Box Jades are a big step up from mx blue style switches as they ditch the common click jacket for a thick click bar which gives a much crisper sound.

The actual click and tactility is produced when the leg on the stem pushes the click bar away from the lower housing and quickly flicks back into place causing the satisfying click as it returns to the lower housing. The tactility in the Box Jades is wonderful and consistent. Despite the 75g springs present in the Box Jades, the actuation force is only 50g and actuates at 1.8mm right after the tactile bump. Although the springs are quite heavy, after the tactile bump, it is hard not to follow through and bottom out at 3.6mm making the switch feel much lighter than it actually is. The Box Jades are a 3 pin switch which means they are compatible with most standard PCBs and are rated for 80 million presses.

Personally, I love the Kailh Box Jades, but it's worth noting that I wouldn't use them in any working environment as they are very loud which will almost definitely prompt some complaints from your co-workers. Overall, I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a clicky switch as they are so much better than any other clicky switch that I have tried and at £0.24 per switch, they are very affordable.
