title: Gazzew Boba U4T Switch Review
description: My review and personal opinion on Gazzew Boba U4T switches.
---
Heya,

This is my review of the Gazzew Boba U4T, but I’d like to preface this by saying that this review is mostly based on my own opinion and some people might have a different opinion and, at the end of the day when choosing switches, it is entirely down to personal preference. With that being said, lets get started!

Gazzew's Boba switches have become a very popular tactile option in the past few months, coming in at around £0.50 per switch they are priced quite reasonably, but they certainly aren't cheap. They are known for their deep "thocky" sound signature and satisfyingly rounded but prominent tactile bump. They are available in both 62g and 68g variants, but this review is based on the 68g model. The U4Ts are manufactured by Otemu which might seem quite off putting as they aren't known for their premium switches. Although, if they continue to produce switches to the standards of the U4Ts then I think that will soon change. The Bobas are a 5 pin switch which makes them nice and stable for hot-swap builds, but can cause issues with some PCBs; in which case you'd need to clip the extra legs off.

I tested the U4Ts stock paired with my CU65, and I have to say that I love them. Even stock, they are extremely "thocky" and aren't at all scratchy. Also, the stem wobble is minimal and the housings are very tight so I wouldn't recommend filming them. The Bobas have a short pre-travel before a satisfying tactile bump and smooth downstroke before bottoming out. The upstroke is concise with a light tactile pop; almost to indicate that the switch has returned. These are great stock switches, and personally I don't find it necessary to to lube them. As they are a tactile switch, thick lube like Krytox 205G0 can make the bump feel lesser and sluggish, so if you do choose to lube them: keep that in mind.

Personally, I'm a big fan of the Gazzew Boba U4Ts, and I'd even go as far to say they are currently my favourite tactile switch! Overall, I'd recommend them to anyone who prefers a much deeper "thocky" sound signature and likes a prominent tactile bump.
