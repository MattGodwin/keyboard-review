description: My top 5 list of budget keycaps.

Heya, 

Today I have compiled a list of my favourite budget keycaps; all of which can be found by following their respective links as listed. In no particular order, lets get started!

### 1. AKKO Neon Keycap Set

([Purchase Link](https://www.banggood.com/custlink/v33yjjdGlq))

The AKKO Neon Keycap set is an amazing budget option coming in at around £40 on Banggood. They follow a cyberpunk style theme and use two colour PBT molding which means that they are almost impossible to fade. The set comes with a great variety of novelty keys and comes with an included keycap puller. Personally, I am a fan of the pink and purple colour scheme and I'd recommend these keycaps to anyone in the market for some PBT keycaps.

### 2. AKKO Keys World Tour

The AKKO Keys World Tour are a great Tokyo themed keycap set with a pink and white colour scheme. With 114 keys included, this set is suitable for any 60% to full sized keyboard. Personally, I'm a fan of the novelty art on the space bar and enter key as it adds a bit of personality to the set. This set is dye-subbed which means that the keycaps shouldn't fade as fast as standard printed keycaps you might find elsewhere. For around £35, your can't go wrong with them.

### 3. Tang Dynasty Keycap Set

([Purchase Link](https://www.banggood.com/custlink/v3GEoOdoNy))

This keycap set follows a purple and white colour scheme and comes with a great selection of novelties and themed keys, such as the space bar and enter key. This set takes advantage of dye-sublimation which gives a crisp image and isn't vulnerable to fading. The Tang Dynasty set is made from PBT which means that they don't fade as easily as most ABS keycaps will. This set is a great option for anyone looking for a purple and white keycap set on a budget.
